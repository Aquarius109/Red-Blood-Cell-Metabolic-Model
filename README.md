# Red-Blood-Cell-Metabolic-Model
This project is an assignment for Dynamic Simulation in Bioengineering (UCSD). I have reconstructed the metabolic pathway within a human red blood cell by merging models of glycolysis, AMP metabolism, and hemoglobin. The steady state of the model was graphed using the MASSpy Python package. Phosphofructokinase regulation is also analyzed.
